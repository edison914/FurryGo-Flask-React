# `FurryGo`
FurryGo is an online community hub where pet lovers can discover and review animal-friendly businesses. The app was developed using Flask in Python for the backend and React.js for the frontend. Vue.js serves as the primary front-end tooling and build system. The demo provides users with features such as sign-up, sign-in, full CRUD operations on pet-friendly places, reviews with pictures, rating places, and bookmarking them. Additionally, images of the places and reviews are uploaded, updated, and maintained on AWS S3.

## MVP - Feature & Implmentatiom
*Log-in and Sign-up*
* The server allows existing users to log in using their created email and password, which are hashed for protection on the backend.
* The server also allows new users to sign up for a new user account. There are email, username and password validators in place that prevent duplicate signups and mismatched passwords.

*Use of AWS S3*
* All pictures for places and reviews are uploaded, stored, and managed on an AWS S3 bucket. Only logged-in users are able to perform these actions. Whenever a user deletes an image, it is also removed from the AWS S3 bucket. Similarly, when a user edits or updates an image, the old image is deleted from the bucket, and the new image is uploaded to the bucket. The backend database then updates the image URL to reflect the latest upload. This dynamic upload/update process ensures optimal space utilization on the AWS S3 Bucket, preventing the accumulation of legacy files that are unused and inaccessible.
